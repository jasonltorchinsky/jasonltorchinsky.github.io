<p class="animated fadeInUp">Throughtout the history of this country, black voices have been silenced. Law enforcement officers, since their inception in the United States, have a history of physically exerting this opression, whether it be by returning runaway slaves or murdering innocent people of color. Over the past weeks, protests and riots have risen up across the country to speak out against these injustices. Many protests have been met with draconian acts of violence carried out by local and federal forces. The atrocities need to stop.</p>
<p class="animated fadeInUp">Many organizations and individuals have put out statements regarding these issues, in far more powerful words than I could ever muster. Although it is a small gesture in the grand scheme, I would like to quote some of these passages on this page: </p>

        <p class="animated fadeInUp">Jason Torchinsky's Webpage for all Jason Torchinsky webpage-related needs.</p>
	<p class="animated fadeInUp">Hello! I’m Jason Torchinsky, a third-year Ph.D. student in the Mathematics department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I obtained my bachelor’s degree in mathematics and physics from <a href="https://www.union.edu/news/stories/201806/class-2018" title="Union College Class of 2018 List"> Union College in 2018</a>. </p>
	<p class="animated fadeInUp">I am currently working with <a href="https://www.math.wisc.edu/~stechmann/" title="Professor Samuel Stechmann's Webpage"> Professor Samuel Stechmann</a> on projects pertaining to parallel computing in computational climate science. In the past, I have done research in computational fluid dynamics at Los Alamos National Labs and Union College, computational topology at Union College, as well as computational algebraic number theory at California State University Channel Islands as part of their 2017 Summer REU. </p>
	<p class="animated fadeInUp">My research interests are primarily in computational mathematics and simulating physical systems using high-performance computing (even for the small simulations I do now!)</p>
	<p class="animated fadeInUp">I was a teacher’s assistant in my department during the 2018-2019 academic year, and am now funded by the <a href="https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/" title="The DOE CSGF Webpage">Department of Energy’s Computational Science Graduate Fellowship</a>.</p>
