    <p>Hello! I’m Jason Turner, a second-year Ph.D. student in the Mathematics 
    department at the University of Wiscosnin-Madison. I obtained my bachelor’s 
    degree in mathematics and physics from 
    <a href="https://www.union.edu/news/stories/201806/class-2018"
       title="Union College Class of 2018 List">
       Union College in 2018</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>I am currently working with 
    <a href="https://www.math.wisc.edu/~stechmann/"
       title="Professor Samuel Stechmann's Webpage">
       Professor Samuel Stechmann</a>
    on projects pertaining to parallel computing in computational climate 
    science. In the past, I have done research in computational fluid dynamics 
    at Los Alamos National Labs and Union College, computational topology at 
    Union College, as well as computational algebraic number theory at 
    California State University Channel Islands as part of their 2017 Summer 
    REU.</p>
    
    <p>My research interests are primarily in computational mathematics and 
    simulating physical systems using high-performance computing (even for the 
    small simulations I do now!)</p>
    
    <p>I was a teacher’s assistant in my department, although this upcoming 
    academic year I will be funded by the 
    <a href="https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/"
       title="The DOE CSGF Webpage">
       Department of Energy’s Computational Science Graduate Fellowship</a>.
