### About Me

Hello! I'm Jason Turner, a first-year PhD student in the Mathematics department at the University of Wiscosnin-Madison. I obtained my bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics from Union College in 2018.

I am currently working with [Professor Samuel Stechmann](https://www.math.wisc.edu/~stechmann/) on projects pertaining to parallel computing in computational climate science. In the past, I have done research in computational fluid dynamics at Los Alamos National Labs and Union College, computational topology at Union College, as well as computational algebraic number theory at California State University Channel Islands as part of their 2017 Summer REU.

My research interests are primarily in computational mathematics and simulating physical systems using high-performance computing (even for the small simulations I do now!)

I am curently a teacher's assistant in my department, although next academic year I will be funded by the [Department of Energy's Computational Science Graduate Fellowship](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/).
